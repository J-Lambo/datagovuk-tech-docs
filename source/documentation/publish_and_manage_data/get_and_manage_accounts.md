# Get and manage accounts

To publish and manage datasets on data.gov.uk you must have an administrator (admin) or editor account.

Each account is associated with an organisation responsible for the dataset. For example, a local authority or central government department.

Editors and admins can both create and edit datasets, but admins can also:

* add and remove editors
* manage editors’ activity
* update information about their organisation(s)

Editors and admins can join multiple organisations.

## Get an account

To get an account you can ask an existing editor or admin to invite you or register for an account.

### Register for an account

If you can’t find an existing member to invite you, you can [register for an account](https://data.gov.uk/support).

When completing the form, state whether you need editor or admin permissions.

You’ll then be able to add and manage datasets on data.gov.uk.

## Add or remove editors and admins

An organisation can have multiple editors and admins.

You can add additional editors or admins to an organisation via the [Data Publisher](https://ckan.publishing.service.gov.uk/). You must have an admin account for that organisation.
