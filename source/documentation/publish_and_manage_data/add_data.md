# Add data manually

If you don’t want to [automatically harvest datasets](harvest_data/), you can add a dataset to data.gov.uk using an online form. You must submit one form per dataset.

>You cannot use the form for publishing INSPIRE/Location data. See the guidance on [harvesting INSPIRE data](inspire/) for more information.

Sign into the [Data Publisher](https://ckan.publishing.service.gov.uk/).

1. Go to **Datasets**.
1. Select **Add dataset**.
1. Complete the fields with information about the dataset.
1. Add contact details for the dataset.
1. Select **Next**.

You can submit 2 sets of contact details per dataset. One set of contact details should be used for Freedom of Information (FOI) requests only.

You can edit the dataset information anytime after it’s published.

Once you have added information about the dataset, you can add the dataset itself.

1. Select **Add new resource**.
1. Complete the fields.
1. Select **Publish**.

>As a signed in user, you’ll see any new datasets or changes immediately. However, changes may take up to one hour to appear to end users. Please be aware of this when notifying people or announcing releases.

## Add an organogram

Central government and agencies must publish organograms of all staff positions on data.gov.uk every 6 months. Organograms are published:

* in a [collection of visualisations](https://data.gov.uk/organogram/)
* as raw data in CSV format

Some organisations, such as intelligence agencies, are exempt from publishing organograms.

Local authorities must publish senior staff data in a [different format](http://schemas.opendata.esd.org.uk/OrganisationStructure).

### When to publish organograms

You must publish the data twice a year. Take a ‘snapshot’ of the roles on 31 March and 6 September and publish them on data.gov.uk by 6 June and 6 December respectively.

### What to include

For SCS pay band 2 (or equivalent) and above you must publish the:

* name of the person
* pay (in £5k pay bands)
* grade
* unit
* contact phone/email
* job title
* role reported to
* full time equivalent (FTE)
* salary cost of reports
* professional/occupational group

For SCS pay band 1 (or equivalent) you must publish the same information as for SCS pay band 2, but without the name or pay.

For junior roles at below SCS pay band 1 (or equivalent) you must publish the:

* unit
* senior role reported to
* grade
* payscale range
* generic job title
* number of posts in FTE
* professional/occupational group

### How to publish an organogram

1. Create your organogram using the [standard template](https://ckan.publishing.service.gov.uk/publisher-files/Blank_Organogram_Template_latest.xls).
2. Sign into the [Data Publisher](https://ckan.publishing.service.gov.uk/).
3. Select **Datasets**.
4. Select **Add dataset**.
5. Complete the fields with information about the organogram.
6. Select the appropriate schema for your organogram (xxx) ***IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE A LINK?***.
7. Select **Next**.
8. Upload or link to the organogram and complete the remaining fields.
9. Select **Publish**.

>Make sure you select the correct schema for the organogram when publishing. Use:

>* `Organisation structure including roles roles & salaries` for central government organograms
>* `Organisation structure (for LGTC by LGA)` for local authority organograms

See the [organogram schema documentation](https://github.com/datagovuk/schemas/tree/master/organogram) for more information.

## Add spend data

Central and local government bodies (including NHS) must publish the details of their expenditure transactions every month. This guidance explains how to add these details to data.gov.uk.

### About spend data

Central government must publish spend data one month in arrears. HM Treasury provides [advice on publishing spend over £25,000](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-publishing-spend-over-25000), including templates and published examples.

Local government must publish information every month or as soon as it becomes available. The [local government transparency code](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-government-transparency-code-2015) explains what local authorities should publish and when.  

### Add new spend data

To add a new dataset, sign into the [Data Publisher](https://ckan.publishing.service.gov.uk/).  

1. Find the dataset you want to update.
1. Select **Manage**.
1. Select **Add data**.
1. Select **Add new resource** and add details of the dataset you want to upload.
1. Select **Publish**.

The new data will be added to the existing dataset.

>Each organisation should only have one dataset for spend over £25,000 and another for GPC spend data. Do not create a brand new dataset for each month.
